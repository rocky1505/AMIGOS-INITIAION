Questline:

1. The Gloom Sage

Player enters the Abandoned Cathedral and encounters Eldric.

Eldric: "Ah, another soul braves the desolation of Altheran. Many have come before you, and none have returned. I am Eldric, the Gloom Sage, and I sense a great purpose within you. If you seek to lift the curse, you must first unravel the tale of the forgotten king. Seek out Lady Isolde in her forsaken manor. She holds fragments of the truth."

2. Lady Isolde's Lament

Player makes their way to Isolde's Manor, navigating through twisted streets and battling hollowed inhabitants. In the decaying halls of the manor, they find Lady Isolde.

Lady Isolde: "A visitor... in this desolate place? I am Isolde, once a lady of this city. Now, merely a wraith bound by sorrow. The forgotten king... his name was Altharon, my beloved. His fall brought this curse upon us. To understand his plight, you must find the Lost Knight, Mordred. He wanders near the city's outskirts, lost in his own torment."

3. Mordred's Regret

Player ventures to the outskirts and finds Mordred, the Lost Knight, sitting by a dying bonfire.

Mordred: "So, you've come to hear a tale of despair. I was once a knight of Altheran, sworn to protect King Altharon. When the darkness consumed him, we tried to resist, but failed. I fled, leaving him to his fate. If you truly wish to end this curse, retrieve Altharon's crown from the depths of the Obsidian Throne Room. Only then can his spirit be put to rest."

4. The Obsidian Throne Room

Player delves into the depths of Altheran, battling through twisted creatures and traps, until they reach the Obsidian Throne Room. There, they confront the tormented spirit of King Altharon.

King Altharon: "Mortal... you dare disturb my eternal torment? My crown... it holds the power to break this curse, but it is bound by my soul. Defeat me, and the curse shall be lifted."

After a fierce battle, the player defeats King Altharon and retrieves his crown.

5. The End of the Curse

Player returns to Eldric in the Abandoned Cathedral with the crown.

Eldric: "You have done it. The crown... and with it, the curse shall be broken. Altheran may yet see a new dawn. But remember, even in victory, darkness lingers. Take this as a token of my gratitude and a reminder of the fragility of hope."

Eldric hands the player a relic: the "Eclipsed Emblem," a powerful artifact that symbolizes the balance between light and dark.

Eldric: "Go now, brave soul. Your journey does not end here. May your path be guided by the echoes of those who came before you."
